# 🧪 Arturo Package Lab

Or... package ideas for **[Arturo](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo)**

This isn't a real repo, properly-speaking, more like a collection of ideas that could become Arturo packages (although not implemented yet!). 

> 💡 If you want to add one, just edit this file 😉

--------------

- [ ] GitHub API wrapper, e.g. [this Ruby gem](https://github.com/piotrmurach/github)
- [x] A benchmarking suite, like [Hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine)
   - 🟢 [Peregrino](https://github.com/drkameleon/peregrino.art)
- [ ] An HTML-generation DSL, like [this](https://github.com/arturo-lang/art-html-module) - still very draft-ish
- [ ] A database/SQL DSL, like [this](https://github.com/arturo-lang/art-db-module) - also very draft-ish, but shouldn't be too difficult to implement
- [ ] A context-free grammar parser, like [this python package](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
